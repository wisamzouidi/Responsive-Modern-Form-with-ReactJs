# Responsive-Modern-Form-with-ReactJs

This project features a responsive login page built with React and styled using CSS. The page is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across both large and small devices.

The login form includes fields for email and password, with a submit button. The layout is modern, clean, and easy to use. The form's container has a flexible width that adjusts based on the screen size, ranging from 70% of the screen width on larger devices to 90% on mobile devices.

Key features:
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, using CSS media queries to adjust the width of the form container based on the viewport size.
Simple Form: Users can input their email and password to log in, with basic form validation.
Modern UI: The login page is visually appealing, with a clean and minimal design.
React State Management: User input is managed using Reactâ€™s useState hook.
This project can be a starting point for building more complex login systems with added features such as authentication, form validation, and backend integration.
